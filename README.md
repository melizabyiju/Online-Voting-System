# E-Voting System

A secure, reliable, and educational desktop voting application implemented in Java with a Swing GUI. This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and core custom data-structure implementations while providing a simple, auditable digital election workflow.

## Abstract

The E-Voting System automates and secures the voting process by combining clear OOP design with custom implementations of fundamental data structures. Voters can cast ballots through a Java Swing interface, administrators can manage elections and participants, and the system produces sorted results and tamper-evident audit logs. Key structures include a Singly Linked List for voter records, an Array-based Circular Queue for handling voting requests, and an Array-based Stack for audit logs. Searching and sorting algorithms validate inputs and present results efficiently, while meaningful exceptions handle invalid operations (duplicate votes, invalid candidates, unregistered voters).
