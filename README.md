# E-Voting System

A secure, reliable, and educational desktop voting application implemented in Java with a Swing GUI. This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and core custom data-structure implementations while providing a simple, auditable digital election workflow.

## Abstract

The E-Voting System is a software application designed to automate and secure 
the voting process using fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented 
Programming (OOP) and core Data Structures. The system provides a digital 
platform where voters can cast their votes, administrators can manage elections, 
and results are generated efficiently. 
The project implements a Singly Linked List to manage voter records, an 
Array-based Circular Queue to handle voting requests, and an Array-based 
Stack to maintain audit logs, ensuring transparency and accountability. Core 
algorithms such as searching are used to validate voters and candidates, while 
sorting is applied to display results in order of votes. 
The application is built with a clear class hierarchy, featuring entities such as 
Voter, Admin, Candidate, and ElectionController, and it uses meaningful 
exception handling to manage invalid operations like duplicate voting, invalid 
candidate selection, or non-registered voter access. 
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed using Java Swing provides an 
interactive experience, including modules for voter login, vote casting, and 
result display. By combining OOP design, custom data structure 
implementation, and user-friendly interfaces, this project ensures reliability, 
security, and efficiency in conducting elections digitally.
